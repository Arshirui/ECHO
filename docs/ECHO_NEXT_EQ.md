# ECHO Next EQ

ECHO Next EQ is a playable HiFi DSP feature. It is intentionally transparent about the signal path: enabling EQ disables bit-perfect output, even when the selected device path is WASAPI Exclusive or ASIO.

## Phase 1 Scope

- 10-band graphic/parametric hybrid EQ
- fixed band Q, currently `1.0`
- draggable band center frequency from `20 Hz` to `20 kHz`
- preamp from `-12 dB` to `+6 dB`
- band gain from `-12 dB` to `+12 dB`
- enable/bypass
- built-in and user presets
- curve visualization
- spectrum analyzer placeholder and native hook point
- clipping/headroom warning

Default band frequencies:

```text
31 Hz, 62 Hz, 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, 16 kHz
```

## Bit-Perfect Rules

EQ enabled:

- `eqEnabled = true`
- `dspActive = true`
- `bitPerfectCandidate = false`
- `bitPerfectDisabledReason = eq_enabled`
- UI shows that output is not bit-perfect

EQ disabled/bypassed:

- native output crossfades back to the dry signal
- EQ must not alter audio once bypass smoothing reaches zero
- `bitPerfectCandidate` may recover if no other DSP, resampling, or output mismatch is active

Flat preset is not the same concept as disabled. Flat has `0 dB` bands and `0 dB` preamp, but if EQ remains enabled the signal path still passes through DSP and is not bit-perfect.

## Native DSP Structure

Native files:

- `native/audio-engine/EqTypes.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqBand.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqProcessor.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqProcessor.cpp`
- `native/audio-engine/EqPresetStore.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqPresetStore.cpp`
- `native/audio-engine/EqMessageProtocol.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqMessageProtocol.cpp`

`EqProcessor` is the realtime component. It owns per-channel biquad state, atomic target parameters, preamp smoothing, band gain smoothing, bypass crossfade, and clipping risk detection.
Band gain and center frequency are both atomic targets. Frequency movement is smoothed before coefficients are recalculated, so horizontal curve dragging does not require locks or UI access inside the callback.

`EqMessageProtocol` parses JSON-line control messages outside the audio callback and updates atomic targets. The PCM stream remains on stdin; realtime EQ commands use a localhost JSON-line control socket so control traffic never mixes with audio bytes.

## Realtime-Safe Rules

The JUCE callback must not:

- allocate large objects
- read or write JSON
- access Electron, React, IPC handlers, or UI state
- wait on a mutex
- perform preset file IO

Parameter updates must:

- clamp invalid values
- use atomic target values
- smooth gain/preamp changes over roughly `25 ms`
- crossfade bypass over roughly `15 ms`
- avoid NaN output during rapid parameter changes

## Electron Bridge

Renderer components use `window.echo.eq` only. The renderer never touches audio buffers.

Commands:

- `eq:get-state`
- `eq:set-enabled`
- `eq:set-band-gain`
- `eq:set-band-frequency`
- `eq:set-preamp`
- `eq:set-preset`
- `eq:reset`
- `eq:list-presets`
- `eq:save-preset`
- `eq:delete-preset`

Example native control request:

```json
{ "type": "eq:set-band-gain", "band": 3, "gainDb": 2.5 }
```

```json
{ "type": "eq:set-band-frequency", "band": 3, "frequencyHz": 360 }
```

Example event/state response:

```json
{
  "type": "eq:state",
  "enabled": true,
  "preampDb": -3,
  "bands": [{ "frequencyHz": 31, "gainDb": 0, "q": 1 }]
}
```

## Preset Format

```json
{
  "id": "bass-boost",
  "name": "Bass Boost",
  "preampDb": -2,
  "bands": [
    { "frequencyHz": 31, "gainDb": 4, "q": 1 }
  ],
  "createdAt": "built-in",
  "updatedAt": "built-in",
  "readonly": true
}
```

Built-in presets:

- Flat
- Bass Boost
- Vocal Clear
- Treble Sparkle
- Loudness
- Night
- Headphone Warm
- Anime / J-Pop
- Rock
- Classical

`Flat` is readonly. User presets are stored as JSON under Electron `userData`, validated on load, and rejected if malformed.

## UI Structure

`EqPanel` contains:

- enable/bypass switch
- preset selector
- reset
- EQ curve view
- analyzer placeholder
- preamp slider
- draggable curve nodes for gain and frequency
- precision controls for selected band frequency, gain, Q, filter type, channel link, and phase mode
- bit-perfect/headroom warning
- preset save/delete controls

Curve movement is throttled while dragging, with accurate gain and frequency values sent on release.

## Later Scope

- full parametric bands
- realtime analyzer
- dynamic EQ
- auto gain
- A/B compare persistence
- per-output profile
- per-headphone profile

Not in scope:

- VST host
- convolution or room correction
- AutoEQ database
- network preset marketplace
- lyrics/MV/streaming coupling
